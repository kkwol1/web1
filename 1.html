of interest to a multidisciplinary readership. The journal seeks to publish work at the interface between physical technological advancements and high impact
 applications that are of direct interest to a broad audience.</p><p><img src="coding.png" width="100%">
The most important factor used to assess manuscripts that are submitted to Lab on a Chip is novelty. Papers should demonstrate novelty in both: (i) the device physics,
 engineering, and materials; and (ii) applications in biology, chemistry, medicine. Submissions that describe novelty in both device and application are most likely to be published.
 Outstanding papers featuring novelty in either the device or the application may also be published.
All manuscripts should be written such that they are accessible to scientists in all disciplines associated with the following subjects, across both academic and industrial sectors.</p>
